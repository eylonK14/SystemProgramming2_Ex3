# Catan

This Project impelments the Catan game board.

The game involves players building and expanding settlements, cities, and roads on the fictional island of Catan. Players must strategically trade and manage resources like brick, lumber, wool, grain, and ore to grow their territories and earn victory points. Dice rolls determine resource production, and players can negotiate trades with each other to obtain the resources they need. Victory is achieved by being the first player to accumulate 10 victory points through construction, development cards, and special achievements like the longest road and largest army.

## Execution

The are two files being executed in the project: `demo` and `test`.
